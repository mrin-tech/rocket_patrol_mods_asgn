Project title: Ghost Hunter

Date: 17th April 2022

Time to complete: 15 hours

Points Explaination:

Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi) (60):
I created a ghost theme where the player has to shoot salt at the ghosts who are trying to escape the graveyard.
I created all the artwork and the music was copyright free.

Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (20)

Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10):
Referenced code from https://phaser.discourse.group/t/countdown-timer/2471/4 to create timer. The timer is in Play.js

Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (5):
The background music I added is copyright free (credit to the musician: Music by NaturesEye from Pixabay)

Track a high score that persists across scenes and display it in the UI (5)
